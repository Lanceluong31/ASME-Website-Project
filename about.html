        <h3>
            
    Welcome to our ASME Madison page! Our club offers so much more than just engineering general experience and we are open to all majors from all backgrounds! Every other Tuesday we have a GM (general meeting) and every other Tuesday we have our Design team meetings. Every GM we have companies from all different engineering industries come and talk about what they do and promote their business which allows students who come the ability to network! Not to mention the free food that comes along with it! This is a great way for engineering students from all backgrounds and years to come, learn, have fun, and network with these companies. For this year's Design Team we will be building a drone with the idea that it carries a block across the competition floor. The competition this year will be in Virginia and it will be held sometime in the spring. We still encourage many people to sign up and be part of the team! Lastly, we have many super exciting events all the time. Many of these events include building terrace chairs, ice cream socials, networking events, hockey games, and so much more! If this seems all so interesting, don't hesitate to reach out to an officer or stop by a GM!

            GMs are a great experience to connect to companies and learn more about what the engineering industry truly is like. We hold GMs every other Tuesday in the ME building and always provide free food for everyone who shows up! This year’s GMs we had companies like AEI, Cretex Medical, and Rockwell Automation. Not to mention, a couple years ago we had SpaceX visit as well! Don’t hesitate to reach out to learn more or stop by a meeting or two to see what it is like!

            Join our Design Team! We are always inviting majors from all different backgrounds to come help with competition building. This year's prompt was to build a drone and to fly it as it picks up an item and places it in a new location. We have many subteams which include mechanical design, electronics and aviation, documentation, propulsion, flight team and a few others. We have a place for everyone to contribute and collaborate and we’d love to have you on our team! For more information, contact any officer or sign up with the links at the GMs! See you there!
